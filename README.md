# Project Description

This was our first software development module (Principle of Computer Systems)

In this module we have studied subjects such as Boolean Algebra, Object Oriented Programming.

The aaplication is a School Management System Windows Form application written in C# with a MySQL database as the back-end, hosted on AWS RDS (Relational Database Service).

The database has been normalized to 4NF (Fourth Normal Form) but a more practical 3NF version was implemented in the final deployment.

Stored procedures have been used to interact with the database and perform call from the application.

And through the nature of the database being relational, inner joins were also used to pull and display related data in certain forms (Students Adress, What students are enrolled in what class or course)

Diagrams were produced including: UML and ER diagrams, Teaching Materials (PowerPoint presentation to showcase the upload and download functionality of the app in the Teaching Material table related to each class)
as well as a Testing Log to track progress.
